4. **Next Paper:** Click "Finish" to move to the next paper
5. **Exit:** Click "Exit" to close (data is auto-exported)

## Important Notes

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start:**
- Ensure PyQt6 is installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version: Python 3.7+

**Lost my progress:**
- Check for `.session.json` file - it contains your current state
- Check `export.json` - it contains saved data

**Discussion field not showing:**
- Select the "Discussion needed" checkbox/radio button for that field
- The field should appear with a yellow highlight
